**BaseCrack-W** is an enhanced version of the Python-based encoding and decoding tool that supports a wide range of character encoding schemes. This tool expands the handling capabilities of conventional encodings and adds support for `Base45` and various improved decoding strategies. It is specifically designed for **CTF challenges**, fast, reliable, and modular!
