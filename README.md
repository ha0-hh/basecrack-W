<h4 align="center">A Decoder Based on Multiple Encoding Formats</h4>  
<p align="center">Original author: https://github.com/mufeedvh/basecrack</p>

**BaseCrack-W** is an upgraded Python-based encoding and decoding tool that supports a wide range of character encoding schemes. The tool extends the capabilities of conventional encoding handling and adds support for `Base45` and various improved decoding strategies. It is specifically designed for **CTF challenges**, fast, reliable, and modular!

## üöÄ **Usage Instructions**  

### **Linux Usage Instructions**  

1. **Decode a single string**  
    ```bash  
    python3 basecrack.py -b SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh  
    ```  

2. **Decode from a file**  
    ```bash  
    python3 basecrack.py -f encoded_file.txt  
    ```  

3. **Magic mode: Decode multi-layer nested encodings**  
    ```bash  
    python3 basecrack.py -m "multi-layer nested encoded string"  
    ```  

### **Windows Usage Instructions**  

1. **Decode a single string**  
    Open Command Prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:  
    ```cmd  
    python basecrack.py -b SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh  
    ```  

2. **Decode from a file**  
    ```cmd  
    python basecrack.py -f encoded_file.txt  
    ```  

3. **Magic mode: Decode multi-layer nested encodings**  
    ```cmd  
    python basecrack.py -m "multi-layer nested encoded string"  
    ```  

For image input in **EXIF/OCR** detection mode **(-i/--image)**:  
        (--exif/--ocr)

**EXIF Data**: Decode image EXIF data **(-e/--exif)**:  
    python basecrack.py -i image.jpg --exif  

**OCR-based encoding detection**: Use OCR to detect base encoding in images **(-c/--ocr)**:  
    python basecrack.py -i image.jpg --ocr  

**Note**: Windows users should ensure that `python` is properly installed and added to the system path. If not installed, download and install it from the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## üìú **API Support**  

BaseCrack-W provides a flexible API that can be easily integrated into other projects.  

**Sample Code**:  
```python  
from decoder import DecodeBase  

encoded_str = "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"  # Base64 encoded string  
decoder = DecodeBase(encoded_base=encoded_str)  
types, results = decoder.decode()  

print("Decoded types:", types)  
print("Decoded results:", results)  
```
